GettingAndCleaningDataAssignment
================================

run_analysis.R contains two functions:

firstdataset() for steps 1-4 of the assignment
seconddataset(x) for step 4 of the assignment

Use this sequence to call both functions at once in R (step 1-5)

x <- firstdataset(); y <- seconddataset(x)
